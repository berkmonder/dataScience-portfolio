### **[OSEMN Framework](https://github.com/berkmonder/dataScience-portfolio/tree/main/OSEMN)**, *Data Science Process*

* **[Obtaining Data](https://github.com/berkmonder/dataScience-portfolio/tree/main/OSEMN/1-Obtain/)**: Developed an **open source package** in Scipy to analyze **chemical kinetic model** of lignin pyrolysis (involving 93 species and 406 reactions) to predict the temporal evolution of molecules and functional groups during chemical reaction
* **[Scrubbing Data](https://github.com/berkmonder/dataScience-portfolio/tree/main/OSEMN/2-Scrub/)**: Implemented **random forest** and <u>*statistical analysis*</u> for electricity generation suggestion model, and built GUI based on Tkinter package, with prioritized resources and revenue plots presented by <u>*matplotlib*</u>
* **[Exploring Data](https://github.com/berkmonder/dataScience-portfolio/tree/main/OSEMN/3-Explore/)**: Implemented **random forest** and <u>*statistical analysis*</u> for electricity generation suggestion model, and built GUI based on Tkinter package, with prioritized resources and revenue plots presented by <u>*matplotlib*</u>
* **[Modelling Data](https://github.com/berkmonder/dataScience-portfolio/tree/main/OSEMN/4-Model/)**: Implemented **random forest** and <u>*statistical analysis*</u> for electricity generation suggestion model, and built GUI based on Tkinter package, with prioritized resources and revenue plots presented by <u>*matplotlib*</u>
* **[iNterpreting Data](https://github.com/berkmonder/dataScience-portfolio/tree/main/OSEMN/5-iNterpret/)**: Implemented **random forest** and <u>*statistical analysis*</u> for electricity generation suggestion model, and built GUI based on Tkinter package, with prioritized resources and revenue plots presented by <u>*matplotlib*</u>

**Keywords:** Data Mining / Python (pandas, matplotlib) / Random Forest / P-Value / GUI

## <p>**[Projects](https://github.com/berkmonder/dataScience-portfolio/tree/main/projects)**

* **Analysis**
  * [Exploratory Data Analysis on MTA Turnstile Data](https://github.com/berkmonder/dataScience-portfolio/tree/main/projects/TurnstileDataExploration): Used **Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn** to clean, transform and visualize data to extract insights.

* **Regression**
  * [IMDb Movies Gross Prediction](https://github.com/berkmonder/dataScience-portfolio/tree/main/projects/IMDbGrossPrediction-Regression): Used **BeautifulSoup** to collect and clean job listing data from IMDb.com

* **Classification**
  * [Rain Prediction](https://github.com/berkmonder/dataScience-portfolio/tree/main/projects/WeatherRainPrediction-Classification): Predictied next-day rain using Australia's Weather data. Imported data to a database, connected with **SQLAlchemy** and deployed using **Flask**.
