### **OSEMN Framework**, *Data Science Process*

* **[Obtaining Data](https://github.com/berkmonder/dataScience-portfolio/tree/main/OSEMN/1-Obtain/)**: In this step, you will need to query databases, and this will include a technical skillset like MySQL to process the data. You may even start out with simple formats like Microsoft Excel to obtain the data and then, later on, convert it into usable data. If you are using Python or R, they have specific packages that can directly read data from these platforms into the programmes

* **[Scrubbing Data](https://github.com/berkmonder/dataScience-portfolio/tree/main/OSEMN/2-Scrub/)**: Implemented **random forest** and <u>*statistical analysis*</u> for electricity generation suggestion model, and built GUI based on Tkinter package, with prioritized resources and revenue plots presented by <u>*matplotlib*</u>
* **[Exploring Data](https://github.com/berkmonder/dataScience-portfolio/tree/main/OSEMN/3-Explore/)**: Implemented **random forest** and <u>*statistical analysis*</u> for electricity generation suggestion model, and built GUI based on Tkinter package, with prioritized resources and revenue plots presented by <u>*matplotlib*</u>
* **[Modelling Data](https://github.com/berkmonder/dataScience-portfolio/tree/main/OSEMN/4-Model/)**: Implemented **random forest** and <u>*statistical analysis*</u> for electricity generation suggestion model, and built GUI based on Tkinter package, with prioritized resources and revenue plots presented by <u>*matplotlib*</u>
* **[iNterpreting Data](https://github.com/berkmonder/dataScience-portfolio/tree/main/OSEMN/5-iNterpret/)**: Implemented **random forest** and <u>*statistical analysis*</u> for electricity generation suggestion model, and built GUI based on Tkinter package, with prioritized resources and revenue plots presented by <u>*matplotlib*</u>
